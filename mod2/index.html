        <p>The food is also really good.  For example, I've gotten this
          beautiful "chicken chicken soup" because I went to a special event in
          the park where some great, well-dressed guys worked on the project.
          It was beautiful, a pretty face of hope for folks looking for an easy,
          clean meal. (Photo by David Brabham )</p>

        <p>I was also impressed by the food at the restaurant (pictured right).
          A really good restaurant. The location is a bit too small, but the
          food is worth it. In my experience, you may be tempted to go at night
          out and try an  offered dinner from the bar or bar, but I think that's
          always worth making a day trip to. </p>

        <p>Sooo much a delicious experience at the Chinese restaurant by Mark
          Niehaus. It's really worth the trip to do for a week or two. For the
          price, the food at the place is very decent and the atmosphere is just
          great. The bartenders are great as well.  I'm in this city to have the
          right food for my money.
          Kazuma no Jizo, a sushi restaurant opened by Sushi No Jizo in
          February, was shut down Monday night, and reopened on Monday. The
          restaurant is open only from 9:30 pm to 5:30 pm. The former sushi
          restaurant was a small sushi bar and sushi parlor, but is now open
          until 10pm.
