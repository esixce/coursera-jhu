  The food is also really good.  For example, I've gotten this beautiful "chicken chicken soup" because I went to a special event in the park where some great, well-dressed guys worked on the project. It was beautiful, a pretty face of hope for folks looking for an easy, clean meal. (Photo by David Brabham )
  I was also impressed by the food at the restaurant (pictured right). A really good restaurant. The location is a bit too small, but the food is worth it. In my experience, you may be tempted to go at night out and try an  offered dinner from the bar or bar, but I think that's always worth making a day trip to. For the price, the food at the place is very decent and the atmosphere is just great. The bartenders are great as well.  I'm in this city to have the right food for my money, and if some good things come of it, then I'm going to go.  Do I have to mention: the whole restaurant was amazing!
  Sooo much a delicious experience at the Chinese restaurant by Mark Niehaus
  It's really worth the trip to do for a week or two.
